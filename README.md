# Multiagent-Reinforcement-Learning

This repository contains the code for training and evaluating multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm based model in a simulated environment with dynamic obstacles. The goal of the agents is to reach a specific target location while avoiding collisions with obstacles.

## Problem statement

Cooperative task completion in multiagent systems presents a significant challenge due to the need for agents to coordinate their actions and avoid obstacles while working towards a common goal. In this project, we aim to develop a solution to this problem by utilizing reinforcement learning techniques to train a team of agents to navigate around obstacles and reach desired positions.
